## The ITIL Service Value System (SVS)

The SVS represents how all components and activities of an organization work together to facilitate value creation:

```
Opportunity/Demand → Guiding Principles → Governance → Service Value Chain → Practices → Continual Improvement → Value
```

## The Four Dimensions

1. **Organizations and People** — Roles, culture, staffing
2. **Information and Technology** — Knowledge, tools, and technologies
3. **Partners and Suppliers** — Third-party relationships
4. **Value Streams and Processes** — Workflows and procedures
