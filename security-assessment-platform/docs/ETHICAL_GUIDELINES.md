- Retain authorization records for compliance purposes

### 2. Scope Compliance
- Only scan systems explicitly included in the authorization scope
- Do not expand scanning beyond agreed-upon targets
- Stop immediately if scanning impacts system availability
- Respect time windows and maintenance schedules

### 3. Data Protection
- Treat all assessment data as confidential
- Store findings securely with appropriate access controls
- Do not share results with unauthorized parties
- Securely destroy assessment data when no longer needed
- Comply with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

### 4. Responsible Disclosure
- Report vulnerabilities through proper channels
- Do not exploit discovered vulnerabilities
- Allow reasonable time for remediation before disclosure
- Follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices

### 5. Professional Conduct
- Follow industry codes of ethics (ISC2, ISACA, EC-Council)
- Maintain objectivity in findings and recommendations
- Do not exaggerate severity to create urgency
- Provide actionable, constructive remediation guidance
