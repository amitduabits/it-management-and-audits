## What Is a Crypto Wallet?

A cryptocurrency wallet is not a container that "holds" coins. Instead, it is a
**cryptographic key management system** that allows you to:

1. **Generate key pairs** -- a private key (secret) and a public key (shareable)
2. **Derive addresses** -- human-readable identifiers computed from your public key
3. **Sign transactions** -- prove ownership of funds by signing with your private key
4. **Interact with the blockchain** -- broadcast signed transactions to the network

The blockchain itself is the ledger that tracks balances. Your wallet simply holds the
keys that prove you control certain addresses on that ledger.

### Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets

Modern wallets use a **hierarchical deterministic** structure defined by several Bitcoin
Improvement Proposals (BIPs):

- **BIP-39**: Defines how a mnemonic phrase (12-24 words) encodes entropy and converts
  to a binary seed
- **BIP-32**: Defines how a master key is derived from the seed and how child keys are
  derived in a tree structure
- **BIP-44**: Defines a standard derivation path structure:
  `m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index`

For Ethereum, the standard path is: `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`

```
Mnemonic Phrase (12-24 words)
        |
        v
   Binary Seed (512 bits)
        |
        v
   Master Private Key + Chain Code
        |
        v
   m/44' (purpose = BIP-44)
        |
        v
   m/44'/60' (coin_type = Ethereum)
        |
        v
   m/44'/60'/0' (account 0)
        |
        v
   m/44'/60'/0'/0 (external chain)
        |
        v
   m/44'/60'/0'/0/0 (first address)
        |
        v
   Ethereum Address (0x...)
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- An Etherscan API key (free at https://etherscan.io/apis)
- An Infura project ID (free at https://infura.io/) -- or any Ethereum RPC provider

## Setup

### 1. Clone and enter the project

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd crypto-wallet-explorer
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and fill in your API keys
```

### 5. Run the CLI

```bash
# Generate a new testnet wallet
python -m src.cli generate-wallet

# Visualize key derivation
python -m src.cli show-derivation

# Build a testnet transaction
python -m src.cli build-tx --to 0xRecipientAddress --value 0.01

# Explore a transaction
python -m src.cli explore-tx --tx-hash 0xTransactionHash

# Check a balance
python -m src.cli check-balance --address 0xAddress
```

### 6. Run tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## How Key Derivation Works

The derivation process transforms human-readable words into cryptographic keys:

1. **Entropy Generation**: Cryptographically secure random bytes (128-256 bits)
2. **Mnemonic Encoding**: Entropy is mapped to words from a 2048-word BIP-39 wordlist
3. **Seed Derivation**: Mnemonic + optional passphrase are stretched via PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512
   (2048 iterations) into a 512-bit seed
4. **Master Key**: The seed is hashed with HMAC-SHA512 using the key "Bitcoin seed" to
   produce a 256-bit master private key and a 256-bit chain code
5. **Child Key Derivation**: Each level of the path (44', 60', 0', 0, 0) derives a child
   key using the parent key, chain code, and index
6. **Address Computation**: The final private key's corresponding public key is hashed with
   Keccak-256, and the last 20 bytes become the Ethereum address

See `docs/KEY_DERIVATION.md` for detailed diagrams and explanations.

## Security Model

This project deliberately makes **no attempt** to secure generated keys because it is an
educational tool. In a production wallet, you would need:

- Encrypted key storage (never plaintext)
- Hardware security modules or secure enclaves
- Memory-safe key handling (zeroing after use)
- Side-channel attack resistance
- Multi-signature schemes
- Air-gapped signing

See `docs/WALLET_SECURITY.md` for comprehensive security guidance.

## Testnet Usage

This tool targets the **Sepolia** testnet. To get test ETH:

1. Visit a Sepolia faucet (see `docs/TESTNET_GUIDE.md`)
2. Enter your testnet address
3. Receive free test ETH (no real value)
4. Experiment with transactions safely

## API Dependencies

- **Etherscan API**: Used for transaction exploration, balance checking, and block data.
  Free tier allows 5 calls/second.
- **Infura / Alchemy**: Used as an Ethereum RPC provider for broadcasting transactions
  and querying chain state.
