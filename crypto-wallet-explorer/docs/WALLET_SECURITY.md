## Understanding Wallet Security

A cryptocurrency wallet's security is fundamentally about **protecting private keys**.
Whoever controls the private key (or the mnemonic phrase that derives it) controls
the funds. There is no "forgot password" option, no customer support to call, and
no way to reverse transactions.

### The Security Triad

```
                    CONFIDENTIALITY
                    (Keep keys secret)
                         /\
                        /  \
                       /    \
                      /      \
                     /________\
        INTEGRITY              AVAILABILITY
   (Keys are not              (You can access
    tampered with)             keys when needed)
```

All three must be maintained:
- **Confidentiality**: No one else can see or copy your keys
- **Integrity**: Your keys have not been modified or corrupted
- **Availability**: You can access your keys when you need to transact

## Key Management

### The Golden Rules

1. **Never share your private key or mnemonic phrase with anyone**
   - No legitimate service will ever ask for your private key
   - No support agent needs your seed phrase to "verify" your account

2. **Never store keys in plaintext**
   - Not in text files, not in emails, not in cloud storage
   - Not in screenshots, not in notes apps

3. **Never type your seed phrase into a website**
   - Real wallet software never asks you to enter your seed phrase
     into a web form

4. **Use different keys for different purposes**
   - Separate "hot" (spending) wallet from "cold" (savings) wallet
   - Use fresh addresses where possible

5. **Verify before signing**
   - Always verify the recipient address, amount, and network
   - Check the transaction details on your hardware wallet screen

### Key Storage Options (Ranked by Security)

```
MOST SECURE
    |
    |  1. Hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor)
    |     - Keys never leave the device
    |     - Transaction signing happens on-device
    |     - Screen verification of transaction details
    |
    |  2. Air-gapped computer
    |     - Computer never connects to internet
    |     - Transactions signed offline, transferred via QR/USB
    |
    |  3. Multi-signature wallet
    |     - Requires M-of-N signatures to authorize
    |     - No single point of failure
    |
    |  4. Encrypted software wallet (desktop)
    |     - Keys encrypted at rest
    |     - Still vulnerable to malware when unlocked
    |
    |  5. Mobile wallet (with secure enclave)
    |     - Uses device's hardware security
    |     - Biometric protection
    |
    |  6. Browser extension wallet
    |     - Convenient but exposed to browser exploits
    |     - Vulnerable to malicious dApps
    |
    v
LEAST SECURE
    |  7. Plain text / unencrypted storage
    |     - NEVER acceptable for real funds
    |     - This is what our educational tool does (by design)

## Mnemonic (Seed Phrase) Security

The mnemonic phrase is the **master key to all derived wallets**. Compromising
the mnemonic compromises every address derived from it.

### Storage Recommendations

**DO:**
- Write it on paper or stamp it into metal
- Store in a fireproof safe or safety deposit box
- Consider splitting across multiple locations (Shamir's Secret Sharing)
- Keep multiple copies in geographically separated locations
- Test recovery from your backup periodically

**DON'T:**
- Store digitally (computer, phone, cloud, email)
- Take a photo or screenshot
- Store in a password manager (single point of failure)
- Share with anyone, ever
- Store all copies in one location

### Metal Backup Solutions

Paper degrades over time and is vulnerable to fire and water. Metal
backup solutions stamp or engrave the seed phrase into steel or titanium:

```
+------------------------------------------+
|  SEED PHRASE METAL BACKUP                |
|                                          |
|  1. abandon    7. abandon               |
|  2. abandon    8. abandon               |
|  3. abandon    9. abandon               |
|  4. abandon   10. abandon               |
|  5. abandon   11. abandon               |
|  6. abandon   12. about                 |
|                                          |
|  WARNING: This example is a known test   |
|  mnemonic. NEVER use it for real funds.  |
+------------------------------------------+
```

### Passphrase (25th Word) Considerations

BIP-39 supports an optional passphrase that:
- Creates a completely different wallet from the same mnemonic
- Provides plausible deniability (different passphrase = different wallet)
- Adds an additional layer of security if mnemonic is compromised
- **Can also cause permanent fund loss if forgotten** (there is no recovery)

---

## Types of Wallets by Security Level

### Hardware Wallets (Recommended for Significant Funds)

Hardware wallets are purpose-built devices that:
- Generate and store private keys in a secure element
- Never expose the private key to the host computer
- Display transaction details on the device screen for verification
- Require physical button presses to confirm transactions

Examples: Ledger Nano X, Trezor Model T, GridPlus Lattice1

### Multi-Signature Wallets

Multi-sig wallets require multiple keys to authorize a transaction:

```
    2-of-3 Multi-sig Example:

    Key A (your hardware wallet)     ----+
                                         |
    Key B (family member's device)   ----+----> Transaction
                                         |     (needs any 2)
    Key C (safety deposit box)       ----+
```

Benefits:
- No single point of failure
- Theft requires compromising multiple keys
- Can include organizational controls

### Custodial vs. Non-Custodial

```
CUSTODIAL (exchange)          NON-CUSTODIAL (your keys)
+--------------------+        +--------------------+
| Exchange holds     |        | You hold your own  |
| your private keys  |        | private keys       |
|                    |        |                    |
| + Easy to use      |        | + Full control     |
| + Account recovery |        | + No counterparty  |
| - Not your keys    |        |   risk             |
| - Exchange risk    |        | - Full responsibility|
| - Can be frozen    |        | - No recovery if   |
+--------------------+        |   keys are lost    |
                              +--------------------+
```

## Common Attack Vectors

### 1. Clipboard Hijacking

Malware that monitors the clipboard and replaces copied cryptocurrency
addresses with the attacker's address.

**Mitigation**: Always verify the full address after pasting. Hardware
wallets show the address on-device.

### 2. Phishing Sites

Fake websites that mimic legitimate wallet or exchange interfaces.

**Mitigation**: Bookmark trusted sites. Verify URLs carefully. Never
click links in emails or messages.

### 3. Malicious Browser Extensions

Extensions that can read and modify web page content, including
transaction details in web-based wallets.

**Mitigation**: Minimize extensions. Use a dedicated browser profile
for crypto. Use hardware wallets.

### 4. SIM Swap Attacks

Attackers convince your carrier to transfer your phone number,
enabling SMS-based 2FA bypass.

**Mitigation**: Use hardware 2FA tokens (YubiKey), not SMS. Use
app-based 2FA (Google Authenticator, Authy).

### 5. Supply Chain Attacks

Compromised hardware or software before it reaches you.

**Mitigation**: Buy hardware wallets directly from manufacturers.
Verify firmware signatures. Use open-source software.

### 6. Dust Attacks

Tiny amounts sent to your address to track your transactions and
potentially de-anonymize you.

**Mitigation**: Don't consolidate dust outputs. Use coin control
features. Consider privacy-focused practices.
